Since the system cut has limitation of 1023 characters/fields I have written my_cut.
USAGE: /1d1/amba/tools/lib/my_cut.out [dc] fn

OPTIONS

dc    sets the field delimiter to c. The default is a SPACE character.

fn    sets the field number to be cut.

LIMITATIONS: Designed only for cutting ONE column at a time. If necessary can be modified  to handle multiple columns.

ERROR: Non-zero field number should be specified.
       missing field number on f option.
